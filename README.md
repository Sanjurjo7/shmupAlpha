# shmupAlpha
Collaborative Shmup Game Project using Pygame and Blender Game Engine.

Sources to start:
  python.org (we're going to try python3 first)
  pygame.org
  blender.org

Concept:
  Scrolling Shmup, start simple and work our way up as we get more. 
  We'll be mostly leveraging Blender for the visual engine and pygame for the game controls themselves. 
  This will be a good practice in importing and using Blender's API for the tasks of object handling.

Ideas:
  Powerups
  Ship varieties (Heavy, Light, Balanced)
  Enemy types (regular enemies and bosses)
  Background ideas (thinking scrolling movie type background, mostly ships in space ala Star Wars Ep 3)

Basic Controls:
  WASD - Movement
  K - fire
